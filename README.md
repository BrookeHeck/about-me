# LAB - 02

## About Me Guessing Game

I build an app with a guessing game that allows a user to learn about me. It personalizes the experience by asking for the user's name and greeting them. It then prompts the user to answer five yes or no questions about me and provides alerts of the correct answer after each question is answered. Lastly, it says thank you for playing and prvoides a summary of correct answers on webpage. This webpage is an interactive way for user's to learn a few fun facts about me.

### Reflections and Comments
This lab was mostly review for me, so nothing really new was learned from the actual code aspect, but I do need major improvement with GitHub. I’ve only used it once before this class and not from the terminal. I know the super basic commands on the terminal, but I need to get better with GitHub. Even though it was review, I still really liked doing the lab because it has been some time since I was coding everyday. It helps to do it consistently so that I don’t have to look anything up. I think eventually GitHub will be second nature to me as well.
