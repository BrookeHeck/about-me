      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Brooke Heck, and I'm from a really small town in Wisconsin where I grew up with two siblings and a big extended family all living close by. After high school, I played college softball and got an associates degree at Madison Area Technical College. Afterwords, I still had no idea what career I wanted and decided to join the Air Force. I worked a logistics job, air transportation, for four years and loved getting the opportunity to live in Germany for two years. During this time, I got my BS in Computer Science at University Maryland Global Campus. After my time in the Air Force,  I left for a major change of pace. I moved to Seattle in June and joined Code Fellows a month later with the hopes of getting a job as a software developer.
